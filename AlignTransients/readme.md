The top most track/items used for the selection is what drives the function of this script.

Use it to align mulitple different elements and make sfx in a batch process. 

Any items selected that go over the number of items in the master track will be uneffected.

Use this in conjunction with my "RandomizeItemsOrder" script to make a bunch of sound effects very quickly.
