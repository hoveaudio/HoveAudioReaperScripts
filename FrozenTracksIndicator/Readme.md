I use these scripts in a custom action to indicate which tracks are frozen. These scripts are in charge of adding/deleting the prefix "ƒ~" in the name of frozen/unfrozen tracks.

Freeze Tracks With Indicator
1. Track: Freeze to stereo (render pre-fader, save/remove items and online FX)
2. Script: ƒ~Prefix.lua

Unfreeze Tracks With Indicator
1. Track: Unfreeze tracks (restore previously saved items and FX)
2. Script: ƒ~PrefixRemoval.lua
