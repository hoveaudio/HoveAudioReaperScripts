Import these manually into Reaper by:
1. Opening up your actions list
2. Click "New Action", then "New ReaScript"
3. Create/name a folder and name the script
4. Copy the code in, then save and exit
5. Enjoy

Check out my youtube where I'll explain these scripts in more detail

I don't know how to code :3
So that's why I didn't set these up for ReaPack
